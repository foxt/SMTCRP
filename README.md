# SMTC Rich Presence
Rich presence for all SMTC apps, a.k.a. the ones that show up when you change the volume.

## Tested with

- [x] [Groove Music](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/groove-music/9wzdncrfj3pt)

- [x] [Dopamine](https://www.digimezzo.com/software/dopamine/)

- [x] [WACUP](https://getwacup.com/) (with `gen_win10shell.dll` plugin)


## Setup

1. Download a [release](https://github.com/thelmgn/smtcrp/releases)

2. Launch the exe.

3. There is no step 3.


## Note about browsers

Because the people at Google and Mozilla think that their browser is the most important app on the system, this app will **IGNORE** any apps starting with `discord`, `firefox`, `chrom` or `opera`, with a strongly worded message and possibly an error. You can ignore both.
